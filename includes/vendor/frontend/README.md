Files in all subfolders of this folder are automatically generated using Bower.

To add or remove third-party packages, modify the `bower.json` file in the root
directory and run `bower install` or `bower uninstall` as needed.

These dependencies are committed into source control for deployment purposes:

> N.B. If you aren't authoring a package that is intended to be consumed by 
> others (e.g., you're building a web app), you should always check installed
> packages into source control.
